# calc
a terminal based calculator using go and cobra

This is a personal exercise to learn cobra and create a 
terminal application keeping in mind good programming practices
for go.

Dependencies
Make sure you have the go compiler installed
https://go.dev/doc/install

To install run install.sh from home directory
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

Binary will be installed in your go path
You should now be able to run the calc application from anywhere in the cli
To check run 'calc version'

Ex:
$ calc version
version is 1.0
